# Taskmanager
YANPTM. Yet another python task manager.

A task management program to keep track of your tasks that you add. Using Flet for the UI and json for the task storage.

Current functionality includes adding tasks via the taskmanager.py file command line arguments, viewing tasks in the UI by running Interface.py

future functionality: Add tasks via UI, delete tasks via UI, calculate time remaining better (just random unix numbers right now), more fleshed out UI. basically lots of stuff
